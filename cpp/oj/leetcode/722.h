namespace _722{
//Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array w
//here source[i] is the i-th line of the source code. This represents the result o
//f splitting the original source code string by the newline character
//.
//
// In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.
//
//The string // denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the
// characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
//
//The string /* denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters un
//til the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of */ should be ignored. (Here, occurr
//ences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, th
//e string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapp
//ing the beginning.
//
//The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occ
//urs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a l
//ine or block comment, it is also ignored.
//
//If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not outpu
//t that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
//
//There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.
// For example, source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";" will not be a test c
//ase. (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comme
//nts.)
//
//It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /
//* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
//
//Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please
//see the examples below for details.
//
//
// After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in t
//he same format.
//
// Example 1:
//
//Input:
//source = ["/*Test program */", "int main()", "{ ", "  // variable declaration
//", "int a, b, c;", "/* This is a test", "   multiline  ", "   comment for ", "
// testing */", "a = b + c;", "}"]
//
//The line by line code is visualized as below:
///*Test program */
//int main()
//{
//  // variable declaration
//int a, b, c;
///* This is a test
//   multiline
//   comment for
//   testing */
//a = b + c;
//}
//
//Output: ["int main()","{ ","  ","int a, b, c;","a = b + c;","}"]
//
//The line by line code is visualized as below:
//int main()
//{
//
//int a, b, c;
//a = b + c;
//}
//
//Explanation:
//The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The str
//ing // denotes line 4 as comments.
//
//
//
// Example 2:
//
//Input:
//source = ["a/*comment", "line", "more_comment*/b"]
//Output: ["ab"]
//Explanation: The original source string is "a/*comment
//line
//more_comment*/b", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion
//, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string "ab", which wh
//en delimited by newline characters becomes ["ab"].
//
//
//
// Note:
// The length of source is in the range [1, 100].
// The length of source[i] is in the range [0, 80].
// Every open block comment is eventually closed.
// There are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source
//code.

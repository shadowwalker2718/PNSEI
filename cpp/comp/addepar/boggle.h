 * Application

I applied online. I interviewed at Addepar in April 2017.

Interview

I was interviewed in two separate phone interviews. Both interviews were similar: describe how to code a simple
 algorithm that the interviewer proposed. The coding was online. Both lasted about 45 minutes.
I thought that I answered the coding questions correctly, but later, I was told that the interview process
 "won't be moving forward."
It seemed like largely a waste of time. Possibly, the position already had an accepted candidate.

Interview Questions

Code the boogle algorithm.


   // https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-find-possible-words-board-characters/

   Given a dictionary, a method to do lookup in dictionary and a M x N board where every cell has one character.
   Find all possible words that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent characters. Note that we can move to any
   of 8 adjacent characters, but a word should not have multiple instances of same cell.

  Input: dictionary[] = {"GEEKS", "FOR", "QUIZ", "GO"};
  boggle[][]   = {{'G','I','Z'},
                  {'U','E','K'},
                  {'Q','S','E'}};
  isWord(str): returns true if str is present in dictionary else false.

  Output:  Following words of dictionary are present
            GEEKS
            QUIZ

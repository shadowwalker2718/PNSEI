// convex function -> gradient descent method
// The centroid or center of mass, defined similarly to the geometric median as minimizing the sum of the 
// squares of the distances to each point, can be found by a simple formula 1717 its coordinates are the averages of the coordinates of
// the points 1717 but it has been shown that no explicit formula, nor an exact algorithm involving only arithmetic operations and kth
// roots, can exist in general for the geometric median.
// Therefore, only numerical or symbolic approximations to the solution of this problem are possible under this model of computation.[14]

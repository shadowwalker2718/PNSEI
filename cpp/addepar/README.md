This is the prompt for your Addepar take-home programming exercise. The rules are:

You may use any tools you like, but please produce a solution we will be able to easily run on a single machine in a typical UNIX environment. Your solution should include:
All source code and any configs or other files necessary to build and run your program.
Full instructions for building and running your program. (Please include this in a README file.)
A quick analysis of the computational complexity and space complexity of your program. (Please include this in the same README file.)
When you are ready to submit a solution, zip up your full solution and reply to this e-mail attaching the zip.
You may use Google, Stack Overflow, etc. for questions about specific library calls, compiler errors, etc., but please do not search for solutions to the overarching problem we're asking you to solve.
There is no strict deadline, but please try to send a timely response. We aren't going to agonize about the difference between a submission that arrives in 2.5 hours and one that arrives in 3, but if you submit 8 hours after receiving the prompt we're likely to wonder what took all that time.
The prompt should be self-explanatory, but if you have any questions about the prompt during the exercise, you can e-mail codingexercise@addepar.com.

The specific prompt for your programming challenge follows.

Best of luck!
